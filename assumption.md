Here I have made following assumption :

a:) Search is exact nataure type.
b:) I have used Jersey Rest API for serving queries.
c:) Filter by city is on the basis of "city" not "usercity".
d:) Filter by address is on the basis of "streetAddress".
e:) Filter by longitude & latitude is on the basis of uniqueness of (longitude,latitude).
f:) Filter by min and max rating is on the basis of minValue and maxValue with exact matching nature.
i:) FOR TDD i haved used rest assured API.
f:) UI is too simple and some part is incomplete.
g:) from UI,Request is hiting by GET with Query param.
h:) Factory pattern have been used for storing hotel deals.
i:) for JSON parsing I have used JSON Based API.
